1) Going to design a functionally multi page website with links to 3 other pages.
2) This website will have a landing page that will contain at minimum a Navbar containing links
on it to the other 3 pages as well as to itself in the form of clickable buttons that will take you to
said pages.
3) The second page will contain cards that have flavor text of your choice, a button for more info
(this goes nowhere for now), and a picture referenced from a website of your choice displaying
a kitten. Three such cards at least must be on the page
4) The third page will contain a table containing the TV listings provided in the screenshot
function that must display a hover function lightup in the color seen in the screenshot
5) The last will contain a form that can be filled out with a submit and a reset button (these go
nowhere for now) that both light up different colors via hover function
